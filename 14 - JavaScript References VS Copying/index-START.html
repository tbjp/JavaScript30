      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Donkey";

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      console.log(players, team4);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 0.8;
      console.log("Object should have age 80");
      console.log(person);
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
      console.log(cap2, person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
